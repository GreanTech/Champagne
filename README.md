# Champagne

Much-needed extensions and utilities for working with IEnumerable&lt;T> in .NET. Methods the BCL ought to have, but doesn't.

## Development

This section describes the development aspects of Champagne.

### Prerequisites

Parts of Champagne, and particularly its tests, are built in F# 3.1, which is the version of F# installed with Visual Studio 2013. A stand-alone [installer for F# 3.1.1 is also available](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41654).
